# ProjectMessageQueue-DataStructures

Hello World!

This is a project on Data Structures.

Do you know Hash Table, Queue, single linked list and double linked list in C#? Why use the built in? Why not write it yourself?

Why would you do that? Well, usualy you don't. But if you want to know how it is done, to decapsulate the incapsulated you need to do that. 

This Messege Queue project does just that. It builds a queue of messages that are groupped by Key value. It holds a chronological order of all the messages sent as well as order of messeges by key. All using custom build queues, lists and hashtable. This project was great to see how data structures work from inside. 

Tech: WPF, C#
